We have a legacy interrupt controller that receives all SPIs as well,
and it can be used as a full replacement for the GIC (with the loss of
nVIRQ/nFIQ) but it cannot wake-up the cores unfortunately. This is all
custom logic, so we could have done at least wake-up based on SPIs, but
we missed that apparently, at least we were consistent.

Out of curiosity, does your GPC somehow know the affinity of a given
interrupt to a particular core?

Right, because for PPIs you leverage the timer broadcast and for SPIs
you have that GPC, so all your left are the remaining "intra GIC"
interrupts which are SGIs.

Yes, that would certainly work, the biggest problem in my case is
dealing with SPIs, since we still have no way to wake-up from those,
other than by getting the help of another CPU that is not power gated.
Lovely, I know.

The systems I use have a GICv2 architecture though this is still no
excuse for not having hooked the nIRQOUT/nFIQOUT to a power management
controller, this is clearly an oversight, and it should have been
possible to automatically take a core out of power gating, since we did
design our own power gating logic, but this was done that way. Hopefully
future designs can remedy that, designers are aware of why this is a
problem now.
