Indeed.

Not entirely. The GRUB hack disables the caches during
ExitBootServices() while the rest of the EFI stub runs with the caches
on. This is actually worse than simply never enabling the caches in
the first place. But we currently deal with both cases, by running the
decompressor's cache_on() routine in SVC mode.

Enabling the I-cache can be done independently, so it does not really
matter (you cannot have dirty cachelines in the I-cache, and
instruction fetches are special memory accesses that can be identified
as cacheable accesses to normal memory regardless of whether the MMU
is enabled and whether a mapping exists)

Enabling the D-cache only has an effect if you enable the MMU, as
otherwise, all data accesses will be implicitly qualified as
non-cacheable device accesses. Since EFI requires a 1:1 mapping, the
only reason for enabling the MMU in the first place is the ability to
enable the D-cache.

So in summary, the M bit is the interesting bit.
