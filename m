Introduction of the Platform Environment Control Interface (PECI) bus
device driver. PECI is a one-wire bus interface that provides a
communication channel from Intel processors and chipset components to
external monitoring or control devices. PECI is designed to support the
following sideband functions:

* Processor and DRAM thermal management
  - Processor fan speed control is managed by comparing Digital Thermal
    Sensor (DTS) thermal readings acquired via PECI against the
    processor-specific fan speed control reference point, or TCONTROL. Both
    TCONTROL and DTS thermal readings are accessible via the processor PECI
    client. These variables are referenced to a common temperature, the TCC
    activation point, and are both defined as negative offsets from that
    reference.
  - PECI based access to the processor package configuration space provides
    a means for Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC) or other platform
    management devices to actively manage the processor and memory power
    and thermal features.

* Platform Manageability
  - Platform manageability functions including thermal, power, and error
    monitoring. Note that platform 'power' management includes monitoring
    and control for both the processor and DRAM subsystem to assist with
    data center power limiting.
  - PECI allows read access to certain error registers in the processor MSR
    space and status monitoring registers in the PCI configuration space
    within the processor and downstream devices.
  - PECI permits writes to certain registers in the processor PCI
    configuration space.

* Processor Interface Tuning and Diagnostics
  - Processor interface tuning and diagnostics capabilities
    (Intel Interconnect BIST). The processors Intel Interconnect Built In
    Self Test (Intel IBIST) allows for infield diagnostic capabilities in
    the Intel UPI and memory controller interfaces. PECI provides a port to
    execute these diagnostics via its PCI Configuration read and write
    capabilities.

* Failure Analysis
  - Output the state of the processor after a failure for analysis via
    Crashdump.

PECI uses a single wire for self-clocking and data transfer. The bus
requires no additional control lines. The physical layer is a self-clocked
one-wire bus that begins each bit with a driven, rising edge from an idle
level near zero volts. The duration of the signal driven high depends on
whether the bit value is a logic '0' or logic '1'. PECI also includes
variable data transfer rate established with every message. In this way, it
is highly flexible even though underlying logic is simple.

The interface design was optimized for interfacing between an Intel
processor and chipset components in both single processor and multiple
processor environments. The single wire interface provides low board
routing overhead for the multiple load connections in the congested routing
area near the processor and chipset components. Bus speed, error checking,
and low protocol overhead provides adequate link bandwidth and reliability
to transfer critical device operating conditions and configuration
information.

This implementation provides the basic framework to add PECI extensions to
the Linux bus and device models. A hardware specific 'Adapter' driver can
be attached to the PECI bus to provide sideband functions described above.
It is also possible to access all devices on an adapter from userspace
through the /dev interface. A device specific 'Client' driver also can be
attached to the PECI bus so each processor client's features can be
supported by the 'Client' driver through an adapter connection in the bus.
This patch set includes Aspeed 24xx/25xx/26xx, NPCM7xx PECI drivers and
PECI cputemp/dimmtemp drivers as the first implementation for both adapter
and client drivers on the PECI bus framework.

Please review.

Thanks,

Jae
