That would make defining a NUMA node mandatory even for non-NUMA
systems?

Indeed. IIUC, the reasoning behind it is related to actual multi-die
x86 packages and some rapl stuff being per-die or per-core.

If we want the die mask to be correct for arm/arm64/riscv we need die
information from somewhere. I'm not in favour of adding more topology
layers to the user-space visible topology description, but others might
have a valid reason and if it is exposed I would prefer if we try to
expose the right information.

Btw, for packages, we already have that information in ACPI/PPTT so it
would be nice if we could have that for DT based systems too.
