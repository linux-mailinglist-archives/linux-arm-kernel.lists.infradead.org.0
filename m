If I remember correctly then Alexander had posted a patch-set
prior to this series where he was reporting every page of a fixed
order from __free_one_page(). But as you said it will be costly as
it will involve one hypercall per page of reporting_order.

Until my v7 posting [1] I was doing this. We did not proceed with
this as blocking allocation was not recommended for reporting.

One issue with asynchronous + array approach was that it could have lead
to false OOMs due to several pages being isolated at the same time.

I will have to think about it.

Precisely.
Although, there would be a scenario where the allocation will
take place for a page whose order would be < REPORTING_ORDER.
In that case, if I decide to ignore all the remaining pages and clear
the previously head free page bit, I might end
up losing the reporting opportunity.

But I can certainly look into this.

That's correct, I was actually trying to come up with a basic framework.
Which is acceptable in terms of benefits and performance and that can fit into
most of the use-cases (if not all).
After which my plan was to further optimize it.
