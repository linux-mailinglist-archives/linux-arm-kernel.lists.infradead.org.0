Now that we have yaml bindings for the thermal subsystem, get rid of the
old bindings (thermal.txt).

Replace all references to thermal.txt in the Documentation with a link
to the appropriate YAML bindings using the following search and replace
pattern:
 - If the reference is specific to the thermal-sensor-cells property,
 replace with a pointer to thermal-sensor.yaml
 - If the reference is to the cooling-cells property, replace with a
 pointer to thermal-cooling-devices.yaml
 - If the reference is generic thermal bindings, replace with a
 reference to thermal*.yaml.

-* Thermal Framework Device Tree descriptor
-
-This file describes a generic binding to provide a way of
-defining hardware thermal structure using device tree.
-A thermal structure includes thermal zones and their components,
-such as trip points, polling intervals, sensors and cooling devices
-binding descriptors.
-
-The target of device tree thermal descriptors is to describe only
-the hardware thermal aspects. The thermal device tree bindings are
-not about how the system must control or which algorithm or policy
-must be taken in place.
-
-There are five types of nodes involved to describe thermal bindings:
-- thermal sensors: devices which may be used to take temperature
-  measurements.
-- cooling devices: devices which may be used to dissipate heat.
-- trip points: describe key temperatures at which cooling is recommended. The
-  set of points should be chosen based on hardware limits.
-- cooling maps: used to describe links between trip points and cooling devices;
-- thermal zones: used to describe thermal data within the hardware;
-
-The following is a description of each of these node types.
-
-* Thermal sensor devices
-
-Thermal sensor devices are nodes providing temperature sensing capabilities on
-thermal zones. Typical devices are I2C ADC converters and bandgaps. These are
-nodes providing temperature data to thermal zones. Thermal sensor devices may
-control one or more internal sensors.
-
-Required property:
-- #thermal-sensor-cells: Used to provide sensor device specific information
-  Type: unsigned	 while referring to it. Typically 0 on thermal sensor
-  Size: one cell	 nodes with only one sensor, and at least 1 on nodes
-			 with several internal sensors, in order
-			 to identify uniquely the sensor instances within
-			 the IC. See thermal zone binding for more details
-			 on how consumers refer to sensor devices.
-
-* Cooling device nodes
-
-Cooling devices are nodes providing control on power dissipation. There
-are essentially two ways to provide control on power dissipation. First
-is by means of regulating device performance, which is known as passive
-cooling. A typical passive cooling is a CPU that has dynamic voltage and
-frequency scaling (DVFS), and uses lower frequencies as cooling states.
-Second is by means of activating devices in order to remove
-the dissipated heat, which is known as active cooling, e.g. regulating
-fan speeds. In both cases, cooling devices shall have a way to determine
-the state of cooling in which the device is.
-
-Any cooling device has a range of cooling states (i.e. different levels
-of heat dissipation). For example a fan's cooling states correspond to
-the different fan speeds possible. Cooling states are referred to by
-single unsigned integers, where larger numbers mean greater heat
-dissipation. The precise set of cooling states associated with a device
-should be defined in a particular device's binding.
-For more examples of cooling devices, refer to the example sections below.
-
-Required properties:
-- #cooling-cells:	Used to provide cooling device specific information
-  Type: unsigned	while referring to it. Must be at least 2, in order
-  Size: one cell	to specify minimum and maximum cooling state used
-			in the reference. The first cell is the minimum
-			cooling state requested and the second cell is
-			the maximum cooling state requested in the reference.
-			See Cooling device maps section below for more details
-			on how consumers refer to cooling devices.
-
-* Trip points
-
-The trip node is a node to describe a point in the temperature domain
-in which the system takes an action. This node describes just the point,
-not the action.
-
-Required properties:
-- temperature:		An integer indicating the trip temperature level,
-  Type: signed		in millicelsius.
-  Size: one cell
-
-- hysteresis:		A low hysteresis value on temperature property (above).
-  Type: unsigned	This is a relative value, in millicelsius.
-  Size: one cell
-
-- type:			a string containing the trip type. Expected values are:
-	"active":	A trip point to enable active cooling
-	"passive":	A trip point to enable passive cooling
-	"hot":		A trip point to notify emergency
-	"critical":	Hardware not reliable.
-  Type: string
-
-* Cooling device maps
-
-The cooling device maps node is a node to describe how cooling devices
-get assigned to trip points of the zone. The cooling devices are expected
-to be loaded in the target system.
-
-Required properties:
-- cooling-device:	A list of phandles of cooling devices with their specifiers,
-  Type: phandle +	referring to which cooling devices are used in this
-    cooling specifier	binding. In the cooling specifier, the first cell
-			is the minimum cooling state and the second cell
-			is the maximum cooling state used in this map.
-- trip:			A phandle of a trip point node within the same thermal
-  Type: phandle of	zone.
-   trip point node
-
-Optional property:
-- contribution:		The cooling contribution to the thermal zone of the
-  Type: unsigned	referred cooling device at the referred trip point.
-  Size: one cell	The contribution is a ratio of the sum
-			of all cooling contributions within a thermal zone.
-
-Note: Using the THERMAL_NO_LIMIT (-1UL) constant in the cooling-device phandle
-limit specifier means:
-(i)   - minimum state allowed for minimum cooling state used in the reference.
-(ii)  - maximum state allowed for maximum cooling state used in the reference.
-Refer to include/dt-bindings/thermal/thermal.h for definition of this constant.
-
-* Thermal zone nodes
-
-The thermal zone node is the node containing all the required info
-for describing a thermal zone, including its cooling device bindings. The
-thermal zone node must contain, apart from its own properties, one sub-node
-containing trip nodes and one sub-node containing all the zone cooling maps.
-
-Required properties:
-- polling-delay:	The maximum number of milliseconds to wait between polls
-  Type: unsigned	when checking this thermal zone.
-  Size: one cell
-
-- polling-delay-passive: The maximum number of milliseconds to wait
-  Type: unsigned	between polls when performing passive cooling.
-  Size: one cell
-
-- thermal-sensors:	A list of thermal sensor phandles and sensor specifier
-  Type: list of		used while monitoring the thermal zone.
-  phandles + sensor
-  specifier
-
-- trips:		A sub-node which is a container of only trip point nodes
-  Type: sub-node	required to describe the thermal zone.
-
-- cooling-maps:		A sub-node which is a container of only cooling device
-  Type: sub-node	map nodes, used to describe the relation between trips
-			and cooling devices.
-
-Optional property:
-- coefficients:		An array of integers (one signed cell) containing
-  Type: array		coefficients to compose a linear relation between
-  Elem size: one cell	the sensors listed in the thermal-sensors property.
-  Elem type: signed	Coefficients defaults to 1, in case this property
-			is not specified. A simple linear polynomial is used:
-			Z = c0 * x0 + c1 * x1 + ... + c(n-1) * x(n-1) + cn.
-
-			The coefficients are ordered and they match with sensors
-			by means of sensor ID. Additional coefficients are
-			interpreted as constant offset.
-
-- sustainable-power:	An estimate of the sustainable power (in mW) that the
-  Type: unsigned	thermal zone can dissipate at the desired
-  Size: one cell	control temperature.  For reference, the
-			sustainable power of a 4'' phone is typically
-			2000mW, while on a 10'' tablet is around
-			4500mW.
-
-Note: The delay properties are bound to the maximum dT/dt (temperature
-derivative over time) in two situations for a thermal zone:
-(i)  - when passive cooling is activated (polling-delay-passive); and
-(ii) - when the zone just needs to be monitored (polling-delay) or
-when active cooling is activated.
-
-The maximum dT/dt is highly bound to hardware power consumption and dissipation
-capability. The delays should be chosen to account for said max dT/dt,
-such that a device does not cross several trip boundaries unexpectedly
-between polls. Choosing the right polling delays shall avoid having the
-device in temperature ranges that may damage the silicon structures and
-reduce silicon lifetime.
-
-* The thermal-zones node
-
-The "thermal-zones" node is a container for all thermal zone nodes. It shall
-contain only sub-nodes describing thermal zones as in the section
-"Thermal zone nodes". The "thermal-zones" node appears under "/".
-
-* Examples
-
-Below are several examples on how to use thermal data descriptors
-using device tree bindings:
-
-(a) - CPU thermal zone
-
-The CPU thermal zone example below describes how to setup one thermal zone
-using one single sensor as temperature source and many cooling devices and
-power dissipation control sources.

-		};
-	};
-};
-
-In the example above, the ADC sensor (bandgap0) at address 0x0000ED00 is
-used to monitor the zone 'cpu-thermal' using its sole sensor. A fan
-device (fan0) is controlled via I2C bus 1, at address 0x48, and has ten
-different cooling states 0-9. It is used to remove the heat out of
-the thermal zone 'cpu-thermal' using its cooling states
-from its minimum to 4, when it reaches trip point 'cpu_alert0'
-at 90C, as an example of active cooling. The same cooling device is used at
-'cpu_alert1', but from 5 to its maximum state. The cpu@0 device is also
-linked to the same thermal zone, 'cpu-thermal', as a passive cooling device,
-using all its cooling states at trip point 'cpu_alert1',
-which is a trip point at 100C. On the thermal zone 'cpu-thermal', at the
-temperature of 125C, represented by the trip point 'cpu_crit', the silicon
-is not reliable anymore.
-
-(b) - IC with several internal sensors
-
-The example below describes how to deploy several thermal zones based off a
-single sensor IC, assuming it has several internal sensors. This is a common
-case on SoC designs with several internal IPs that may need different thermal
-requirements, and thus may have their own sensor to monitor or detect internal
-hotspots in their silicon.

-		};
-
-		cooling-maps {
-			/* each zone within the SoC may have its own cooling */
-			...
-		};
-	};
-};
-
-In the example above, there is one bandgap IC which has the capability to
-monitor three sensors. The hardware has been designed so that sensors are
-placed on different places in the DIE to monitor different temperature
-hotspots: one for CPU thermal zone, one for GPU thermal zone and the
-other to monitor a DSP thermal zone.
-
-Thus, there is a need to assign each sensor provided by the bandgap IC
-to different thermal zones. This is achieved by means of using the
-#thermal-sensor-cells property and using the first cell of the sensor
-specifier as sensor ID. In the example, then, <bandgap 0> is used to
-monitor CPU thermal zone, <bandgap 1> is used to monitor GPU thermal
-zone and <bandgap 2> is used to monitor DSP thermal zone. Each zone
-may be uncorrelated, having its own dT/dt requirements, trips
-and cooling maps.
-
-
-(c) - Several sensors within one single thermal zone
-
-The example below illustrates how to use more than one sensor within
-one thermal zone.
-
-#include <dt-bindings/thermal/thermal.h>
-
-&i2c1 {
-	...
-	/*
-	 * A simple IC with a single temperature sensor.
-	 */
-	adc: sensor@49 {
-		...
-		#thermal-sensor-cells = <0>;
-	};
-};
-
-ocp {
-	...
-	/*
-	 * A simple IC with a single bandgap temperature sensor.
-	 */
-	bandgap0: bandgap@0000ed00 {
-		...
-		#thermal-sensor-cells = <0>;
-	};
-};
-
-thermal-zones {
-	cpu_thermal: cpu-thermal {
-		polling-delay-passive = <250>; /* milliseconds */
-		polling-delay = <1000>; /* milliseconds */
-
-		thermal-sensors = <&bandgap0>,	/* cpu */
-				  <&adc>;	/* pcb north */
-
-		/* hotspot = 100 * bandgap - 120 * adc + 484 */
-		coefficients =		<100	-120	484>;
-
-		trips {
-			...
-		};
-
-		cooling-maps {
-			...
-		};
-	};
-};
-
-In some cases, there is a need to use more than one sensor to extrapolate
-a thermal hotspot in the silicon. The above example illustrates this situation.
-For instance, it may be the case that a sensor external to CPU IP may be placed
-close to CPU hotspot and together with internal CPU sensor, it is used
-to determine the hotspot. Assuming this is the case for the above example,
-the hypothetical extrapolation rule would be:
-		hotspot = 100 * bandgap - 120 * adc + 484
-
-In other context, the same idea can be used to add fixed offset. For instance,
-consider the hotspot extrapolation rule below:
-		hotspot = 1 * adc + 6000
-
-In the above equation, the hotspot is always 6C higher than what is read
-from the ADC sensor. The binding would be then:
-        thermal-sensors =  <&adc>;
-
-		/* hotspot = 1 * adc + 6000 */
-	coefficients =		<1	6000>;
-
-(d) - Board thermal
-
-The board thermal example below illustrates how to setup one thermal zone
-with many sensors and many cooling devices.
-
-#include <dt-bindings/thermal/thermal.h>
-
-&i2c1 {
-	...
-	/*
-	 * An IC with several temperature sensor.
-	 */
-	adc_dummy: sensor@50 {
-		...
-		#thermal-sensor-cells = <1>; /* sensor internal ID */
-	};
-};
-
-thermal-zones {
-	batt-thermal {
