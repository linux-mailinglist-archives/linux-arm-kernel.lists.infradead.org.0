Yes, I am suggesting that the PCI core does not do the right thing
here.

Did you confirm that this resets the devices in question (0000:09:00.0
and 0000:09:00.1, I think), and what reset mechanism this uses (FLR,
PM, etc)?

Case I is using APEI, and it looks like that can queue up 16 errors
(AER_RECOVER_RING_SIZE), so that queue could be completely full before
we even get a chance to reset the device.  But I would think that the
reset should *eventually* stop the errors, even though we might log
30+ of them first.

As an experiment, you could reduce AER_RECOVER_RING_SIZE to 1 or 2 and
see if it reduces the logging.
