I haven't looked into it yet. One situation which I would definitely
want to avoid is to unnecessary invoke bitmap scans when there are not
sufficient free pages available in the zone.
I can take a look at it if required.

In most of the cases No. Similar to Alexander I was also running will-it-scale/
page_fault1 to analyze the performance impact of the patch series and haven't
noticed any significant degradation.
In some specific cases, we may see noticeable degradation due to the scanning
overhead.

Not sure if I understood the question completely.
But yes in my case any workload which is allocating and freeing pages will end
up initiating reporting requests based on the number of free pages in the zone.
