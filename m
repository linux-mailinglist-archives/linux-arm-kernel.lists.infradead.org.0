BPMP needs to know the controller number to enable it hence it needs to be
passed to BPMP. Just for accessing BPMP, I already added 'nvidia,bpmp' property.

This is added mostly for debugging purposes where link is brought up at a lower speed (ex:- Gen-1)
and then by means of SW initiated speed change, it is taken to a higher speed.
I'll remove it from the next patch as I'm not sure if it deserves to go as a common entry.

Well, they are related partially. i.e. if a platform doesn't have 'supports-clkreq' set,
then, by definition, it can't advertise support for ASPM L1.1 and L1.2 states. But, ASPM-L0s
and ASPM-L1 states don't depend on 'supports-clkreq' property.
Having this property gives more granularity as to support for which particular ASPM state
shouldn't be advertised by the root port.

I'm afraid it can't be a common property as not all implementations allow programming capabilty
registers before PCIe link up (as capability registers in a root port's configurations space are
otherwise read-only registers). Since this is more like a feature of Tegra194's PCIe root port,
I added it here.

Ok. I'll change this.

I'm fine with it. I'll drop this for now and push patches to support WAKE at a
later point of time.
