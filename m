We also need to make sure that things don't break. It's a very bad idea
to have a macro with the same name as an enum value for reasons I stated
before. I think that's the most important thing here.

Also, if inversed is a synonym of inverted, we don't loose any precision
at all. All you have to remember is that you're dealing with a device
tree constant in one case and an API enumeration in the other.

So I think the current form is actually more precise, though I guess it
could be confusing if you don't care about the difference.

Q.E.D.

The problem exists there equally. We're probably not running into it
because drivers don't end up including dt-bindings/gpio/gpio.h and
include/linux/gpio/machine.h at the same time. Or they end up always
including them in the right order.

For PWM the situation is slightly more complicated because we only have
one header for the kernel API, so the likelihood of including it along
with the dt-bindings header is increased compared to GPIO.

I don't understand what you're trying to say.

There used to be a time when it was assumed that eventually device tree
sources would live outside of the kernel tree. Given that they are a HW
description, they really ought not to be relying on the Linux kernel
tree as a way of keeping them consistent. That's really only out of
convenience.

PWM_POLARITY_INVERTED is not part of the API. It doesn't exist for
anything other than to make the device tree more readable.

I now regret that we ever introduced this in the first place. Perhaps it
would've been better to just deal with raw numbers instead.
