The compiled DT blobs incl. the kernel image are stored in this artifact
repository. But the sources for the kernel and the DT are in the Linux
repo. This is necessary to be compliant to the GPL.

Stephen Boyd was okay with clk changes except of a small nit. So i fixed
this is as he suggested in a separate series. Unfortunately this hasn't
be applied yet [1].

The i2c, pinctrl and the sdhci changes has been applied yet.

In my opinion it isn't the job of the mainline kernel to adapt to a
vendor device tree. It's the vendor device tree which needs to be fixed.

Sorry, but this is my holiday. I will back after the weekend.

Stefan
