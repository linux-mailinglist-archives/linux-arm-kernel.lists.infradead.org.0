Sure, but what do you think of my wording in the patch ? This is pretty
much what I've done: Keep the current (default) behaviour, which on
x86/ia64 is to claim what's there if it looks sensible and change thing
as deemed fit (reassigned what's not sensible, extent HP bridge
resources etc...).

This patch doesn't change the arm64 behaviour in that case which is to
currently reallocate everything but Lorenzo seems to agree that this
isn't great and we should change towards a more x86-like default, which
I'm working on, but I want to keep that change separate from this
patch, if anything for bisectability of potential regressions.

Right, and this is what x86 does, and this is what we'll eventually do
on arm64 as above.

May or may not be. Seattle platforms here tells us explicitely that we
should ignore the configuration, unless I'm mistaken. Lorenzo do you
know better here ?

So "must not ignore" doesn't mean "keep intact" in my book. In fact, to
be honest, the wording in the spec pretty much means the same for all 3
cases, ie, you "may ignore" or "must not ignore" is bullshit. I can
perfectly "not ignore but decide it's bad and change it anyway". This
is all a terrible wording.

Like all firmware specs, it's designed for people to misinterpret it
and get things wrong :-)

What we know is that there is one platform that implements _DSM #5
today and returns 1 with the intention, unless I misread what I was
told, to tell us to explicitly ignore what FW did.

Well, no :-)

The enum in host_bridge needs to be 3 choices because it's meant to
represent the 3 policies that Linux has today sprinkled accross
architectures in rather inconsistent ways, but I'm not going to break
that in one patch and there are reasons for all 3 to exist. We can
discuss that separately if you want.

I plan to start cleaning up code to use that field to represent the
policies properly accross the board as I also consolidate code accross
archs/platforms.

However, what can possibly be debated here is how _DSM #5 maps to those
3. You think it should map to only two of them, I tend to disagree with
your arguments above but short of sitting on the spec commitee and
clarifying the wording, it's a matter of how has the pointiest hat and
the rounder crystal ball here.

No. "reassign" is "must reassign" or "must ignore FW settings". It may
not be what we want to do with ACPI _DSM #5 = 1, but it's definitely
what all current ARM32, powerpc4xx, and in general most embedded
platforms want today. In fact we have more platforms in the tree who
want just that.

Now you may want to make the argument that those platforms shouldn't
want that, but changing it would probably break a good half of them in
one go, that's what they've always done and I'm not here to mess around
with this.

Once I've consolidated more code, it might become easier on a per
platform basis to chose to switch to the "use what's there and reassign
what's broken or missing" model (ie, "pci_rsrc_normal"), but that will
have to be done on a case by case basis with appropriate testing etc..

For the ACPI case, maybe ... for all the other cases this is pretty
moot. Reassign all is what they do today, and changing it will probably
break them.

Ben.
