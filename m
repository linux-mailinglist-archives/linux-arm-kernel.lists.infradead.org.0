I understand your concern about my less understanding of asid
technology. Here is
my short-description of arm64 asid allocator: (If you find anything
wrong, please
correct me directly, thx :)
The asid allocator use five level check to reduce the cost of switch_mm.
 1. Check if the asid version is the same (it's general)
 2. Check reserved_asid which is set in rollover flush_context() and
the key point is
     keep the same bit position with the current asid version instead
of input version.
 3. Check if the position of bitmap is free then it could be set &
used directly.
 4. find_next_zero_bit() (a little performance cost)
 5. flush_context  (this is the worst cost with increase current asid version)

Check is level by level and cost is also higher with the next level.
The design that
impressed me the most was reserved_asid and bitmap and the 2th level and 3th
level will prevent unnecessary find_next_zero_bit().

The atomic 64 bit asid is also ok for 32-bit system and it won't cost
a lot in 1th 2th 3th
level check.

The operation of set/clear mm_cpumask was removed in arm64 compared to arm32.
It seems no side effect on current arm64 system, but from software
meaning it's wrong.
So I think it should be reserved in generic version.

I'll keep my system use the same ASID for SMP + IOMMU :P
Yes, there are two styles of asid allocator: per-cpu ASID (MIPS) or
same ASID (ARM).
If the CPU couldn't support cache/tlb coherency maintian in hardware,
it should use
per-cpu ASID style because IPI is expensive and per-cpu ASID style
need more software
mechanism to improve performance (eg: delay cache flush). From software view the
same ASID is clearer and easier to build bigger system with more TLB caches.

I think the same ASID style is a more sensible choice for modern
processor and let it be
one of generic is reasonable.

In fact, riscv folks have discussed a lot about arm's asid allocator
and I learned
a lot from the discussion:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-riscv/20190327100201.32220-1-anup.patel@wdc.com/

We are developing C-SKY and RISC-V ISA cpu cores and make it generic
is good for us.
