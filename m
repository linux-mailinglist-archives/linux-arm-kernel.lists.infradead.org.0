Yes, but that still requires the bootloader to expose the file system
via EFI protocols, and it requires some degree of trust in the
contents of the command line. The command line in Linux is a bit hairy
in any case, but allowing it to override the very first thing that
gets executed is something we should try to avoid.

Initrd signing is probably not feasible for this reason. But measuring
it, and using PCR value prediction to reseal keys when they change is
something we should be able to do in this context.

For that reason, it would be preferable for the command line not to
have control over whether or not an initrd gets loaded, and which.

The bootloader already has code for file verification when loading the

No. I am not interested in EFI_FILE_PROTOCOL, only in LoadFile2, which
is a single method that needs to be implemented.

If u-boot will be used to boot RISC-V in EFI mode without GRUB, then I
expect that we will need an implementation of this in u-boot.

We can still sign the initrd and Linux can verify the signature. What
I am after is an interface that does not require the initrd to
originate from a EFI file system protocol, and which doesn't require
the loaded initrd to sit in memory for an unspecified amount of time
and its information passed via DT properties or bootparams structs.

So invoking EFI_FILE_PROTOCOL directly is not going to work,
regardless of whether we get the devicepath from the command line or
from a EFI variable.

It is not only about security. The primary goal is to remove the need
for arch specific knowledge in the firmware about DT, bootparams and
initrd allocation policies without being forced to load the initrd
from a filesystem that is exposed via a EFI protocol.

How does u-boot know today? If you can tell it which initrd to load
into memory, why is it difficult to put that same data into a buffer
in response to a protocol invocation?

If the bootloader is signed, it is justified to place a higher degree
of trust in the code we run than in the [unsigned] data we pass as the
command line.
